# Week 4 Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data which enable to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Analysis
I have created an R script called run_analysis.R which does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Finally, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

For working code and tidy dataset, please check my https://github.com/mbpaglinawan/Week-4-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project repo.
